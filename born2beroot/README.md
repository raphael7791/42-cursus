# Born2beRoot

## Description

This project introduces system administration through virtualization. The goal is to create a secure virtual machine under Debian, implementing strict security rules including SSH configuration, firewall setup, password policies, and system monitoring.

## Instructions

1. Import the virtual machine in VirtualBox (or UTM for Mac M1/M2)
2. Start the VM and enter the disk encryption password
3. Login with user credentials
4. Connect via SSH: `ssh <user>@<ip> -p 4242`

## Resources

- [Debian Documentation](https://www.debian.org/doc/)
- [UFW Manual](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW)
- [LVM Guide](https://wiki.debian.org/LVM)
- [SSH Documentation](https://www.openssh.com/manual.html)

### AI Usage

I used Claude (Anthropic) as a learning tool to:
- Understand concepts (VM, LVM, SSH, firewall, sudo)
- Get step-by-step guidance for configuration
- Debug errors encountered during setup

AI was not used to generate direct solutions but to understand each step of the process.

## Project description

### Operating System Choice: Debian

**Pros:** Beginner-friendly, extensive documentation, large community, stable.
**Cons:** Slower release cycle, older packages in stable version.

Rocky Linux was not chosen due to its higher complexity with SELinux and firewalld.

### Design Choices

- **Partitioning:** Encrypted LVM for data security
- **SSH:** Port 4242, root login disabled
- **Firewall:** UFW with only port 4242 open
- **Password policy:** 30-day expiration, 10 characters minimum, complexity requirements
- **Sudo:** Limited to 3 attempts, full logging enabled

### Comparisons

| Debian | Rocky Linux |
|--------|-------------|
| APT package manager | DNF package manager |
| AppArmor (simpler) | SELinux (more complex) |
| UFW (user-friendly) | firewalld (more features) |

| VirtualBox | UTM |
|------------|-----|
| x86_64 architecture | ARM architecture (M1/M2) |
| .vdi disk format | .qcow2 disk format |
| Windows/Linux/Intel Mac | Apple Silicon Mac |
